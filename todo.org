3. Install the audio driver
4. Reboot

lots of bullshit in accessibility I want to disable:

** DONE Why does the Settings app freeze up every time you do something?

drag and drop support seems to be the primary culprit
also switched to ICH9 chipset
should swap back and forth between 1 and 2 cores just to see

** TODO Should look into automated provisioning inside of WSL - like what linux packages I want
